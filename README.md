## What remains:
1. Speed up the process. Currently the speed (mainly MLE) is too slow. (for rep=1, T=250, Q1 costs around 2.5 seconds; for rep=12, T=250, Q1 costs around 25 seconds; for rep=1, T=1000, Q1 costs around 9 to 10 seconds; so for one rep, T=250, it uses around 15~20 seconds; If we set rep=100, T=1000, it costs 20 * 100 * 4 = 8000 seconds ~= 2~3 hours)
2. Check if location scale NCT is necessary (currently just NCT with loc=0, scale=1)
3. Write reports.
